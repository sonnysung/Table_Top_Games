Strats -- the fun part
    Approaches
        Greedy --Pick the card with the highest possible outcome, even tho it is not guaranteed
            ie. Pick Sasahimi, because it has the highest possible outcome of 10
        Safe  --Pick the highest value card with guaranteed value
            ie. Pick Nigiri or Dumpling because it is a guaranteed value
